Difference Between Generative AI and Agentic AI

Both Generative AI and Agentic AI are advanced forms of artificial intelligence, but they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways.

1. Generative AI
Definition: AI that creates new content (text, images, music, code, etc.) based on patterns learned from training data.

Key Features:
Content Creation: Generates outputs like articles, artwork, or synthetic data.

Reactive: Responds to prompts but doesn’t act autonomously.

Examples: ChatGPT, Gemini, Deepseck, and GitHub Copilot.

Use Cases:
Writing assistance, image generation, music composition, and data augmentation.

2. Agentic AI
Definition: AI that performs tasks autonomously, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals.

Key Features:
Autonomy: Can plan, execute, and adapt without constant human input.

Goal-Oriented: Works towards completing tasks (e.g., booking a flight, managing workflows, or controlling robots, etc.).

Examples: AI personal assistants, autonomous robots, and self-driving cars.

Use Cases:
Customer service bots, automated trading systems, robotic process automation (RPA).


The key differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI are:

1. Primary Role: Generative AI focuses on creating content, while Agentic AI focuses on taking
actions to achieve specific goals.
2. Autonomy: Generative AI operates within the boundaries of its programming and training data, whereas
Agentic AI can operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without constant human input.
3. Output: Generative AI produces content like text, images, or music, whereas Agentic
AI completes tasks, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve its goals.
4. Examples: Generative AI includes chatbots, image generators, and code completion tools, while
Agentic AI includes self-driving cars, AI personal assistants, and robotic process automation (RPA).

Overlap
Some systems combine both, like an AI agent that uses generative AI to draft emails while autonomously sending them.

Future Outlook:
Agentic AI is a major focus in AI research (e.g., OpenAI’s work on autonomous agents, DeepMind’s adaptive systems). As it evolves, governance frameworks will be crucial to ensure safe and beneficial deployment.

OpenAI Agents SDK:

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a lightweight, Python-first framework for building “agentic” AI applications. At its core, it provides a small set of primitives—Agents (LLMs configured with instructions and optional tools), Handoffs (delegation between agents), and Guardrails (input/output validation)—plus built-in tracing so you can visualize, debug, and evaluate multi-agent workflows. 

Why Use the Agents SDK?

Orchestration of Complex Tasks: Rather than a single LLM responding to prompts, you can coordinate multiple specialized agents to work together toward a goal.

Minimal Learning Curve: The SDK wraps common patterns (tool calls, delegation, validation) in a small, consistent API, letting you move from prototype to production without wrestling with dozens of abstractions.

Provider-Agnostic: While optimized for OpenAI’s own Responses and Chat Completions APIs, it also supports 100+ other LLM providers, making it easy to switch or experiment with different models.

Key Benefits

Modularity & Reuse:

Define discrete agents with clear responsibilities and tools.

Delegate tasks automatically via handoffs, reducing bespoke orchestration code.

Built-In Observability:

Automatic tracing of each agent run, so you can inspect prompts, responses, tool calls, and decisions in a UI.

Safety & Validation:

Guardrails enforce schema or content rules on inputs/outputs, reducing unexpected behavior.

Rapid Iteration:

Python-first design means you can leverage your existing Python ecosystem (unit tests, packaging, deployment) to build and ship agents quickly.

Production-Readiness:

Production-ready features (logging, tracing, evaluation hooks) are included out of the box, unlike early experimental libraries.
